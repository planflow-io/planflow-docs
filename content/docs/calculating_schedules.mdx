title: Calculating Schedules
description: Early and late dates
---

Calculating schedules in LeanCPM is slightly different than in legacy CPM.

Here are the main differences:
- Tasks do not have constraints, including “Start as soon as possible”
- There are only two types of dependencies
	- **Series**: A blocker must finish before the blocked can start
	- **Parallel**: A start-start and finish-finish relationship 
- All Milestones have a “Must Finish On” or “Must Start On” date
- [[Soft logic]] is driven by resource capacity

## What data is analyzed and processed

Calculating schedules takes the following **inputs** only:
- The earliest task(s) `start` date
- All tasks:
	- duration (in work days)
	- dependencies/dependents
		- type (series or parallel)
		- lag (parallel only)
- All Milestones:
	- `must_finish_by` or `must_start_by` date

The following outputs are calculated:
- All tasks: 
	- `early_start` `date`
	- `early_finish` `date`
	- `late_start` `date`
	- `late_finish` `date`
	- `total_float`  `number`
### What isn’t analyzed or processed
Let’s be clear. Calculating the schedule doesn’t affect what's shown on the schedule. The tasks shown on the canvas use the `start` and `finish` dates, which have no relation to early or late dates.

Legacy CPM will automatically assign the `early_start` to the start date. Planflow / LeanCPM 


Calculating schedules is easy. Here’s how it works.

1. Find the task with the earliest `start`
2. If there is more than one with the same `start` date, you’ll repeat the process for each.
3. This start date is now the `early_start` for this task (this only happens with the first task)
4. Add the task’s duration in work days to find the `early_finish` 
5. Find the dependents of the task (Series or Parallel), for each dependent:
