title: Calculating Schedules
description: Early and late dates
---

Calculating schedules in LeanCPM is slightly different than in legacy CPM.

## Main Differences from legacy CPM

1. There is no concept of constraints (As soon as possible, Start no earlier than, etc.)
2. There is no data date, only Today
3. Start & Finish are manually set by the user; they are *mostly* ignored in calculating the schedule
4. There are only two types of dependencies (relationships)
	- **Series**: A blocker must finish before the blocked task can start
	- **Parallel**: A start-start and finish-finish relationship with an optional lag
5. Milestones can only be in series with their dependents and dependencies
6. Schedules are calculated in days, not minutes or seconds.


## What exactly is calculated?

| Field              | Type     | Tasks | Issues | Milestones |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| `early_start`      | date     | ✅     |        |            |
| `early_finish`     | date     | ✅     |        |            |
| `early_date`       | date     |       |        | ✅          |
| `late_start`       | date     | ✅     |        |            |
| `late_finish`      | date     | ✅     |        |            |
| `deadline`         | date     |       |        | ✅          |
| `priority`         | enum     | ✅     | ✅      |            |
| `total_float`      | duration | ✅     | ✅      |            |
| `free_float_start` | duration | ✅     |        |            |
| `free_float_end`   | duration | ✅     | ✅      |            |
| `drag`             | duration | ✅     |        |            |

<Callout title="Legacy CPM" type="warn">
 Legacy CPM will automatically assign the `early_start` and `early_finish` to the nominal start and finish dates, respectively. This is not the case in LeanCPM, instead it is the expected dates, the manual, user-generated dates, or actual dates that are assigned to the start and finish dates.

Calculating schedules is easy. Here’s how it works.

## What is ignored

Anything that has a "cancelled" [status](status) is not considered in the calculation.

In LeanCPM, any task, regardless of Status, who's [nominal](terms/nominal_dates) Start or Finish is before Today isn't used for the calculation, however any residual calculated fields from [above](#what-exactly-is-calculated) will remain untouched. For example, if Task A was set to Start next week and the schedule were calculated today, all of the relevant fields from above would be calculated. Fast forward 2 weeks, the schedule hasn't been calculated since, but is now triggered, Task 2 will still show all of the same data.

## Forwards Pass - Calculating Early Dates



Forward pass first - calculate early dates (the soonest tasks can start/finish)
1. for all tasks & milestones who start or finish today or earlier:
	a. set `needs_update` to `true` 
	b. do not remove existing early dates
2. for all other tasks find all tasks & milestones without a dependency (predecessor) AND ...

    **a.** whose `expected_start` & `expected_finish` (user-generated) is after today, for each:
	- set `early_start` to today + 1 work day
	- set `early_finish = early_start + duration`
		
	**b.** whose start is ≤ today AND finish > today
	
	- set `early_finish = expected_finish` (user-generated)
3. find all dependents (successors) of tasks from previous step
    a. for each series dependent (FS):
	    set `early_start` to dependency's (predecessor's) `early_finish + 1d` (work day)
    b. for each parallel dependent (SS or SS + Lag):
	    set `early_start` to dependency's `early_start + lag*` (in workdays)
	    > set early start to dependent's `early_finish` - task's [duration](duration) 
    c. for all dependents (series & parallel):
	    set `early_finish = early_start + duration`
    d. for all Finish Milestones:
	    set `early_date` to dependency's `early_finish` (same day, not the day after)
    e. for all Start Milestones
	    set `early_date` to dependency's `early_finish + 1d` (work day)
	f. for tasks dependent on Milestones
		set `early_start` to dependency's (milestone's) `early_date`
4. Repeat step 4 until early dates for all tasks & milestones have been calculated
5. Move onto the Backwards pass to calculate the late dates (the latest tasks can start/finish)


## Backwards Pass

<Callout title="Unknown Priority" type="error">
 Any task or issue that doesn't eventually lead to a milestone has an unknown priority
</Callout>
1. Set late dates to null
2. Find all tasks without a dependent (successor)
	a. for each:
		set `priority` to `unknown`
		set  late_finish to finish (user-generated)
		set late_start = late_finish - duration
