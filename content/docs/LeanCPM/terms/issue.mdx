Issues are somewhat in-between Tasks & Milestones. Like tasks they have the following fields:


| Field                | Description                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Status               |                              |
| Expected Date        | early finish; user-generated |
| [Deadline](deadline) | late finish; calculated      |
| Priority             |                              |

Identified Priority = Successorâ€™s priority  
In progress Priority = Successors Latest Start - Issue Expected Date - 1d

Expected date = Start date  
Successors Early Start -1d = Early Finish  
Successors Late Start -1d = Late Finish
