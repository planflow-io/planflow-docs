title: Nominal dates

Start and Finish dates. LeanCPM, like legacy CPM, has many date fields for each task, as seen in this guide. The nominal dates are the bottom line, the most important dates, the dates you share with your subcontractors and with your clients. 

All other dates are supplemental information for you as a planner.

The Start and Finish, known as the nominal dates, are usually driven by the [expected dates](terms/expected_dates).

### Start

When the task’s [status](status) is not set to `started`, `finished`, or `completed`, the value `start` will be set to the [expected start](expected_dates#expected-start) date. Otherwise, it will be set to the [actual start](actual_dates) date.

## Finish

When the task’s [status](status) is not set to `finished` or `completed`, the value `finish` will be set to the [expected finish](expected_dates#expected-finish) date. Otherwise, it will be set to the [actual finish](actual_finish) date.
