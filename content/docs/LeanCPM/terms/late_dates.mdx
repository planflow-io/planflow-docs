title: Late Dates
description: The latest possible dates a task can start and finish
---
Late dates are calculated in the [backwards pass](/docs/LeanCPM/calculating_schedules#backwards-pass).

Late dates cannot be calculated for a task path (a set of tasks connected by dependencies) that doesnâ€™t eventually lead to a Milestone.

## Late Start

`late_start`

The latest date a Task can *start* is based on when its [dependents](dependencies) are finished or started, depending on the dependency type (series or parallel).

## Late Finish

`late_finish`

The latest date a Task can finish is based on when its dependencies are finished and its duration.

## Milestones

Unlike Tasks, [Milestones](milestone.mdx) have a single `early_date` field. This is the soonest a Milestone can occur. 

<Callout title="Legacy CPM" type="warn">
 In legacy CPM, Milestones have an Early Start and an Early Finish, but depending on the type, only one is used.
