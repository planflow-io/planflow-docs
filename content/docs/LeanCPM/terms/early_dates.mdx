title: Early Dates
description: The soonest possible date a task can start or finish
---
These values are [calculated](calculating_schedules.mdx) based on durations and dependencies between all tasks in a project.

## Early Start

`early_start`

The earliest a task can start is based on when its dependencies are finished or started, depending on the dependency type.

## Early Finish

`early_finish`

The earliest a task can *finish* is based on its `early_start` and [duration](duration).

## Milestones

Unlike Tasks, [Milestones](milestone.mdx) have a single `early_date` field. This is the soonest a Milestone can occur.
