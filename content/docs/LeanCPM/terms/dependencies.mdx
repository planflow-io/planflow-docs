## Dependency Types

One of LeanCPM’s superpowers is in its simplicity.  Two types of dependencies, Series and Parallel, make creating schedules easy and powerful.

### Series

Tasks in a series happen one by one. The first must finish before the second can start.

If you’re familiar with legacy CPM, this is a simple Finish-to-Start relationship.

Lag, the desired time between the finish and start, is not supported in series.

### Parallel
Tasks in parallel happen at the same time. However, there is always a leader; the first must start before the second can start, AND the first must finish before the second can finish.

If you're familiar with legacy CPM, this is a Start-to-Start (SS) AND a Finish-to-Finish relationship.

Lag can be added to the start side of the parallel. 


## Dependency Sides

Each Dependency has two sides:
1. The blocker
2. The blocked

## The blocker
The blocker, known as the “predecessor” in legacy CPM, is the task that

## FAQ
How do I show concrete curing? I usually use an FS+lag, but now I can't?
You can! We recommend adding an extra day for curing in your `Pour and Finish` Task
