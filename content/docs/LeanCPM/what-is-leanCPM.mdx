## What is LeanCPM

LeanCPM was created because **I wanted Superintendents to own their schedules.** Since Superintendents don’t have the luxury of sitting in front of a desk all day, they need something easy, flexible, and foolproof while also offloading some of the burden and accountability to subcontractors. 

## Philosophy

#### Logic-Safe
Poor relationships between tasks, or a lack thereof, cause 95% of schedule issues. LeanCPM not only requires the best logic practices but also prevents bad practices, making every schedule as sound as possible, given reasonable input.

#### Synchronous communication
Construction is synchronous: Participants must be present because they rely on the work, resources, or information from others before they can provide the same. With legacy CPM, “the schedule was outdated the day it was published.” 

Updating & maintaining the schedule should be a continuous, real-time operation, not an afterthought. 


#### Bias for action
The problem with legacy CPM is that it is “defensive scheduling” (scheduling for lawyers). 
[It is rooted in a system that ensures nobody finishes early](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dfahmi_the-industry-standard-for-scheduling-is-broken-activity-7300173639910412289-X2qE?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIaG8MBuuNhQamSYI2lMxGTSILVPovdewQ).

LeanCPM doesn’t let you rewrite history. If something is done, you mark it as done that day. Telling the team you finished something a week or a month ago doesn’t do anyone favors. Going to finish a week early? Update the task so that others can be notified and plan accordingly.

## Why LeanCPM

Legacy CPM is challenging to grasp for most. No wonder schedulers are among the highest-paid roles in construction. LeanCPM is for people who work in the field and don’t have time to learn the theory and science behind a flawed system.

Lean, on the other hand, is a total rejection of legacy CPM. It says legacy CPM is flawed because it’s managed in a silo, it’s asynchronous, and it doesn’t reflect reality. While that is all true, Lean Construction forgets the point of CPM, to have a schedule that can automatically adjust, that knows if drywall gets pushed up a week, then paint will too, and so will casework, ceiling grid, and the 10 other tasks that you can’t remember right now.

## When to use LeanCPM
While LeanCPM is easier and more powerful than legacy CPM, some project specs strictly dictate the use of legacy CPM. If that is the case, then LeanCPM and our full suite will not work. 

[Planflow Mobile](https://planflow.io), our award-winning mobile app for executing on Primavera schedules, is an excellent choice for finishing projects early.

No project is too small or too large for LeanCPM. Small personal jobs or multi-billion dollar projects can all benefit from easier planning and better execution.
