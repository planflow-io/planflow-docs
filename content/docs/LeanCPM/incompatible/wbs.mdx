LeanCPM is incompatible with WBS. 

WBS solves a problem in Traditional CPM that doesn’t exist in LeanCPM.

One of the outputs of CPM is a massive task list, known as a Gantt chart.

If designers created design documents like we created schedules, then all disciplines would be on the same drawing, and pages wouldn’t be organized by level or view type. Instead, you’d have to flip to random pages to try to find the area you wanted to see, with small parts of other areas. For example, the label for Level 1 might be on a different page than most or all of the actual design for Level 1.

Work Breakdown Structure allows you to put your list of hundreds or thousands of tasks into a hierarchical structure. This is easier for the person creating the schedule, but makes digesting it more difficult.

## How LeanCPM projects are structured

If you’re familiar with Activity Codes from Primavera or SureTrak, then the concept here is very similar.



## Areas
While not required, we recommend that all projects use a standard or template list of Areas and that software providers display them in a Kanban view.

Here’s a standard list of Areas we recommend every project start with:

### Phase (Turnover)
This will be different on every project. If you have different phases as outlined in the design documents, for example, you 
1. Early Release Projects
2. Phase 1 - Tower
3. Phase 2 - Garage

### Phase
Below is a standard way of grouping work for most construction projects. Heavy Civil or other infrastructure projects will have different lists.

1. **Site**: Site clearing, earthwork, utilities, erosion & sediment control, roads, parking, landscaping, lighting, etc.
2. **Pre-construction**: Planning, design, permits, and site preparation.3. **Substructure**: Deep and shallow foundations, temporary and permanent retaining walls, excavation4. **Superstructure**: Steel, Cast-in-place Concrete, Precast Concrete, structural CMU5. **Envelope**: Exterior walls, roofing, and glass.
6. **Buildout**: Framing, Drywall, Overhead & In-Wall MEP, Doors & Frames7. **Systems**: Mains, equipment, and rooms, for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems, vertical transportation
8. **Specialty**: Baggage Handling, Kitchens, Canopies, Art9. **Finishes**: Flooring, paint, fixtures, Division 10, casework, appliances10. **Post-construction**: Commissioning, furnishings, inspections, handover

### Floor
Floor will be different on every project, however it’s good to keep the names consistent. I always recommend to keep things as concise as possible, without losing meaning. While the design docs might call Level 1 “Level 1”, “Floor 1”, or “1st Floor”— keeping it concise and consistent across projects makes it easier for everyone —“L1” is a great choice as everyone knows what it means, it doesn’t take up space on your plan.
- B2
- B1
- L1
- L1.5
- M
- L3
- LR
- HR

### Floor Area

Floor Area is usually used for the #Buildout. Floor plans are broken up into smaller chunks so that multiple crews can work in different floor areas at the same time. Here, we recommend using geographical naming schemes like “North” or “Kitchen.”

TIP: Avoid using sequential terms like 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C. There are 2 main reasons: 
1. Things rarely go according to plan. Sequence 3, 1, 2 doesn’t make sense. 
2. Without a map, 1, 2, 3 doesn’t make sense

Referencing the Life Safety Plans is the best way to break up floors into areas. Use the highest fire-rated walls as your lines between floor areas.

### Elevation
This is universally understood: in construction, the elevation represents the side or face of the project. The most common representations are directional. 

An interesting potential conflict is with [Floor Areas](#floor-area). If your floor areas match your elevations, maybe you don’t need a floor area?

Some standard elevations:
- North
- West 
- South 
- East
- NorthWest
- 

### Why do it this way

The biggest problem with traditional CPM is the lack of historical data. This is due in part to the lack of structured data. Isn’t it ironic that Work Breakdown *Structure* isn’t structured?

The advantage of Area labels is that a simple task like “Install Light Fixtures” can be tagged with `2nd Floor` , `Above Ceiling`, 

Another advantage is for when you have similar work across areas.
