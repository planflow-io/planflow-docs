Planflow is a construction scheduling tool that allows Superintendents to own their schedule, providing flexibility *and* accountability while maintaining the principles of Lean construction and the Critical Path Method (CPM).

## LeanCPM
Unlike other scheduling software, which either use a Lean approach or a Critical Path Method (CPM) approach, Planflow uses LeanCPM. This means that it combines the best of both worlds, allowing you to create a schedule that is flexible, easy to use, and is fully parametric, ensuring that your project can adapt to changes quickly and efficiently.
