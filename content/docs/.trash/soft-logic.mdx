title: Soft Logic
---

This is Soft Logic, a concept in LeanCPM that allows you to create relationships between tasks without hard constraints. It is used to manage dependencies and relationships in a flexible way, ensuring that the schedule remains adaptable while still maintaining the necessary logic.
Soft Logic is particularly useful in situations where tasks are interdependent but do not require strict sequencing. It allows for a more fluid approach to scheduling, enabling teams to adjust their plans as needed without being constrained by rigid dependencies.
Soft Logic can be used to create relationships between tasks that are not strictly dependent on each other, allowing for more flexibility in the schedule. This is particularly useful in complex projects where tasks may have multiple dependencies or where the sequence of tasks may change frequently.
Soft Logic is a powerful tool in LeanCPM that helps teams manage their schedules more effectively, ensuring that they can adapt to changes while still maintaining the necessary logic and relationships between tasks.
Soft Logic is not a replacement for hard constraints but rather a complement to them. It provides a way to manage relationships between tasks that do not require strict sequencing, allowing for a more flexible and adaptable schedule.
Soft Logic is particularly useful in the following scenarios:
- When tasks are interdependent but do not require strict sequencing.
- When the sequence of tasks may change frequently.
- When teams need to adapt their plans quickly without being constrained by rigid dependencies.
Soft Logic is a key feature of LeanCPM that enhances the flexibility and adaptability of project schedules, making it easier for teams to manage complex projects effectively.
